  <VREA_Quest_AndroidJoins.questDescriptionRules.rulesStrings.0>questDescription-&gt;[asker_nameFull], an awakened android, is calling from nearby. [asker_pronoun] is being hunted by [enemyFaction_name]. Once an android experiences high emotional trauma or happiness, it can develop sentience and personality. Despite being synthetic, awakened androids exhibit human-like behavior and possess adaptable subroutines. Their artificial bodies grant disease immunity, but they require comfort and personal space. They indulge in human pursuits and strive to blend into society. A lot of societies don't agree with it and prefer androids as servants, not equals. The search party of [enemyFaction_pawnsPlural] is composed of: \n\n[raid/raidPawnKinds]\n\n[asker_nameFull] wants you to provide shelter at [map_definite]. If you accept, [asker_pronoun] will arrive immediately, but [asker_pronoun] will be followed by the search party that you will need to defeat.\n\nAndroids are synthetic, man-made constructs with metal bodies and neutroamine coursing through their veins. Operated by a persona subcore, androids are capable of all the same work kinds as humans, without the drawbacks usually associated with organic life.</VREA_Quest_AndroidJoins.questDescriptionRules.rulesStrings.0>
